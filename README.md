This tutorial will guide you step-by-step to create a currency converter application using C#, SplashKit, and an online currency exchange API. You'll learn how to:
- Design a user-friendly interface.
- Fetch real-time exchange rates via an API.
- Implement asynchronous programming.

## Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, you'll need:
1. **C# Basics**: Familiarity with programming in C#.
2. **SplashKit Installed**: [Get started with SplashKit here](https://splashkit.io).
3. **Currency API Key**: Sign up for a free API key at [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).

## Features of the App
